# Dynamic-Pricing-Optimization

In this project, I developed a data-driven approach to optimize pricing strategies for businesses, leveraging Python to analyze data, predict demand, and recommend optimal price points. The goal was to maximize revenue while maintaining market competitiveness.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared historical pricing and sales data.

Demand Prediction: Built machine learning models to predict customer demand based on pricing.

Optimization: Implemented optimization algorithms to identify the best pricing strategies.

Visualization: Created insightful visualizations to showcase findings and recommendations.

Technologies Used:

Python

pandas

NumPy

scikit-learn

matplotlib & seaborn

scipy


Results:

Predicted demand with a high degree of accuracy.

Recommended pricing strategies that increased simulated revenue by [X]%.






Identified key factors influencing customer purchase behavior.
